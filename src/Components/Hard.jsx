                <h1 className="lato darkText" style={{margin:"5px"}}>Adjacency Matricies</h1>
                <p>I'll be simplifying some of the linear algebra needed for this section. This is a brief overview that's sufficient for UIL purposes. Here's an example of an adjacency matrix:</p>
                <CodeComponent code={adjacencyMatrix}></CodeComponent>
                <p>The first row represents node 1 of the graph. A edge exists between the nodes if <br/><b>adj[i][j] == 1 </b><br/> (for example, since the first node is adjacent to nodes 2 and 3, there is an edge betweeen them.) Try drawing out this graph.</p>
                <p>Adjacency matricies are often used in search questions, such as depth-first or breadth-first searches. I'll cover those next.</p>
                <p>Example questions from the UIL exam:</p>
                <CodeComponent code={'//UIL 2022 A \nUsing the adjacency matix from above: \nA bridge is a graph edge whose removal would cause a graph to become disconnected. \nAbove is the adjacency matrix of graph G where adj[I][J] = adj[J][I] = 1 \nIf a bidirectional edge exists between vertices I and J. How many bridges exist in G?'}></CodeComponent>

                <img src={graph2} alt="graph2"></img>
                <p>Answer: undirected unweighted (no arrows, no weights)</p>

                <p>There always is one or two questions about non-programming topics on the exam. Common ones will be covered here:</p>

                <p>What is an inorder, postorder, and preorder traversal of the tree?</p>
                <CodeComponent code={travSol}></CodeComponent>
                <h1 className="lato darkText" style={{margin:"5px"}}>Two's Complement and Polish Notation</h1>
                <p>These are my least favorite topics on the exam. Here's a brief overview of them:</p>
                <p>The easy one: two's complement. Simply flip all of the bits and then add one.</p>
                <CodeComponent code={`Write the signed 8-bit binary two's complement representation of the lowest number that is possible to be represented in this form.`}></CodeComponent>
                <p>Solution: 10000000. <br/>Explanation from UIL: The last bit of a 2â€™s complement number can be viewed as a negative 2^n. Hence the smallest value that can be made is only the last bit and no positive bits to increase it. Hence, 10000000.</p>

`## Graphs Overview
- Graphs are made up of nodes (circle shapes) and edges (lines).
- Edges connect pieces of the graph. A connected component is all of the pieces that are reachable through some path.
- Length of path = number of edges on it
- A path is a cycle if it starts and ends at the same node.
- A **graph** is connected if you can reach any node from any other node.
- A weighted graph assigns weights, or values, to each edge. For example, a model estimating costs between cities might use this.
- The degree of a node = number of edges leaving it.
- A directed graph has arrows (direction)`
